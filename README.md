# Chess Game

Hello, I'm Jack Kennedy (JackRKennedy on GitHub). This repository, `ChessGame`, holds the source code for a Chess Game developed in Java. 

## Introduction

Chess Game is a chess application built using Java. It provides a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the chess board. Currently, it allows for a tactile base game, with plans to implement an AI opponent for an enhanced and challenging gaming experience.

## Future Enhancements

An important future enhancement for this project is the implementation of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) opponent using the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning. This AI logic will be developed in C++ due to its efficiency and control over system resources, which are critical for advanced AI computations. The goal with this AI is not just to create an opponent, but to create one that can provide varying levels of difficulty - creating an engaging experience for beginners and chess experts alike. Though the AI will be implemented in C++, the user interface (UI) and the base logic will remain in Java to maintain ease-of-use and cross-platform compatibility.

## Features

- Interactive buttons representing a chessboard
- Color differentiation for the chess squares
- Hover effect for user-friendly interactiveness
- Color change to signify selected squares
